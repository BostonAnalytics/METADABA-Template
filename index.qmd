## Course Overview

### Course Description

This SQL Bootcamp is designed to teach students, particularly those in applied business analytics and data science, the foundations and advanced techniques of SQL using both **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**. Over nine modules, you will master fundamental SQL concepts such as querying data, working with joins, stored procedures, transactions, and more. Each module is accompanied by self-guided learning tasks, quizzes, and practical assessments to ensure a deep understanding of database concepts.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon completing the SQL Bootcamp, you will be able to:

- Understand and write basic SQL queries.
- Retrieve, manipulate, and manage data efficiently.
- Work with multiple tables using joins and set operations.
- Create and manage databases, tables, and indexes.
- Understand and implement stored procedures, functions, triggers, and transactions.

### Total Time Required

- **Instructor-led learning**: 2 hours (each module for 20 minutes)
- **Self-guided learning and assessments**: 4 hours combined

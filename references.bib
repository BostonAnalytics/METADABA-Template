   abstract = {3rd edition. It's not easy to design good application interfaces in a world where companies must create compelling, seamless user experiences across an exploding number of channels, screens, and contexts. Design patterns, design systems, and component-based UI frameworks have emerged and now rapidly evolve to meet the challenge. This bestselling book is one of the few reliable sources to help you navigate through the maze of design options. By capturing UI best practices and reusable ideas as design patterns, Designing Interfaces provides solutions to common design problems that you can tailor to the situation at hand. This updated edition includes patterns for mobile apps and social media, as well as web applications and desktop software. Each pattern contains full-color examples and practical design advice that you can use immediately. Experienced designers can use this guide as a sourcebook of ideas; novices will find a roadmap to the world of interface and interaction design.},

   abstract = {From the Publisher: Complete coverage of basic design principles illustrated by student examples. Design for Communication offers a unique approach to mastering the basic design principles, conceptual problem-solving methods, and critical-thinking skills that distinguish graphic designers from desktop technicians. This book presents forty-two basic to advanced graphic design and typography assignments collaboratively written by college educators to teach the fundamental processes, concepts, and techniques through hands-on applications. Each assignment is illustrated with actual student solutions, and each includes a process narrative and an educator's critical analysis revealing the reasoning behind the creative strategies employed by each individual student solution. Assignments are organized from basic to advanced within six sections: The elements and principles of design; Typography as image; Creative word play; Word and image; Grid and visual hierarchy; Visual advocacy. Design for Communication is a highly visual resource of instruction, information, ideas, and inspiration for students and professionals.
